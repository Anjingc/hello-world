# hello-world
For the time honored tradition

Greetings.
I am at a loss when asked to write a bit about myself but I can talk technical all night long, and have an endless curiosity when it comes to how things work. I frequently have the pleasure of diving into technologies I've never worked with and over the years have experienced technologies that are not widely available, some few remember, and others that now only exist in museums. I never tire of learning new technologies, how the infrastructure works, how the applications are developed, how to manipulate the systems, and how to develop system tools to automate processes that make those systems more efficient.
